	<li/>(a) a spear or (b) a short sword (if proficient)
	<li/>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor

</ul>
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<h4>Cantrips</h4>
<p>You begin knowing no cantrips. You learn new medium cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Medium table.
</p>

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>As a medium, you have one spell slot of each spell level you can cast as shown under 'spell level' on the Medium table. The table also shows how many spells you know at each level. To cast one of your medium spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot of equivalent level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<p>You prepare the list of medium spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of medium spells from your spells known equal to your Intelligence modifier + half of your medium level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have one 1st, 2nd and 3rd-level spell slot. To cast the 2nd-level spell Detect Thoughts, you must spend either your 2nd or 3rd level spell slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of medium spells requires time spent studying manuscripts or in meditation to recall the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
</p>

<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the medium spell list or your spiritual discipline.
</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Medium table shows when you learn more medium spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new medium spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the medium spells you know and replace it with another spell from the medium spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your medium spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a medium spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a shaman's focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your medium spells.</p>

<h3>Channeling</h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to channel a willing spirit. You can expel the spirit from your body as an action, ending all effects from channeling. After channeling a spirit, a medium must take a short rest before channeling a different spirit.
</p>
<p>When channeling, you gain the spirit's weapon proficiencies and access to some of its abilities. During this time, you also add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that your channeled spirit is proficient in and you can add your proficiency to attack rolls made with any weapon the spirit is proficient in. If the spirit can cast spells, you can use your slots to cast them. You must use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability when casting these spells and you do not need to prepare them. You use your Wisdom whenever a spirit's spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spirit's spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p>
<p>Spirit spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p>
<p>Spirit spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</p>
<p>You can channel for two hours, but you can only safely channel an averse spirit for a number of minutes equal to your medium level. If you exceed this, you must roll a wisdom save against a DC equal to the creature's challenge rating +10 and again every round, or lose control of the possession. When this occurs, the spirit controls your body for 1d12 minutes. This can also occur if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die while channeling an averse spirit. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
</p>
<h4>Gaining Favor</h4>
<p>You learn to appease spirits and barter with supernatural forces.
</p>
<p><b>Communing with spirits.</b> First, you must gain the spirit's interest. To gain the attention of a spirit of nature or a soul that has not yet passed, you must make offerings as a part of a ritual which takes 10 minutes times 1d12 to complete. You shouldn't normally need an offering worth much more than 100 gp times the target's challenge rating. A spirit must be summoned from a place relevant to its nature. This can be where the spirit had passed away or somewhere close to its remains (If it was ever alive), the domain in which it resides or haunts, or even in the presence of an item or person of great significance to it.
</p>
<p><b>The barter.</b> You must then convince the spirit to accept an offer in exchange for its knowledge and power. Make a Persuasion check against a DC of 12 + the spirit's CR. If this check fails you cannot try again until the next day. If a spirit does not share your alignment on either axis or has a more specific reason to be against your cause, it is considered averse to you. You have disadvantage when trying to convince an averse spirit to join you. An averse spirit that has a challenge rating of twice your level or more will not help you. You can only summon a spirit in this way once every long rest. Any spirit will be hesitant to follow a medium that already has 3 in his company.
</p>
<p>Any creature within your repertoire can be channeled, but you must spend time communing with it in order to channel it, and attacking such a creature will generally cause it to refuse.
</p>

<h4>Repertoire</h4>
<p>You become proficient in dealing with certain types of spirits. This list of creatures is used by different medium class features.</p>
<p>At 1st level, your repertoire includes the souls of the dead such as ghosts, phantoms and wraiths as well as one additional type of spirit determined by your spiritual discipline. You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your creatures in your repertoire. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.</p>
<p>At 5th, 9th and 13th level, you can add an additional type of spirit to your repertoire from those listed above. You may choose celestials, elementals, fey or fiends.</p>

<div class=sidebar>
	<h3 id="Sidebar: Multiclassing"> Multiclassing:</h3><h4 class=nullMenu>Ghost Touch & Ki strikes</h4>
	<div class=sbBody>
		<p>Having both the Ghost touch and Ki strikes abilities allows you to treat any weapon you hold or throw as magical for purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to physical damage.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h4>Ghost Touch</h4>
<p>At level 3, your connection to the soul manifests more literally, as you can now make full physical contact with ghosts. The "Incorporeal Movement" Ability does not apply for enemy creatures trying to move through your square. your unarmed strikes count as magical against creatures that are listed as being resistant to "Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing From Nonmagical Attacks" (ghosts and some elementals for example). In addition, you can ignore any immunity to the grappled condition.</p>
<ln/>
<h3>Taboo</h3>
<p>Taboo should extend how long you can channel.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, once per short rest, you can take on a taboo befitting the spirit you channel in order to earn greater cooperation. The taboo must be maintained until you complete a long rest. If you break this taboo, your remaining channeling time immediately runs out and you take 1d12 necrotic damage + the spirit's CR. When you take on a taboo, you may regain one spell slot, or gain a bonus to an ability score for 2 minutes. If you choose the latter, select one of the spirit's exemplary ability scores. This can be either the spirit's greatest ability score, or one that is greater than your own. You gain +2 on all saving throws and skill checks that this ability applies to for 2 minutes. You cannot use this ability to maintain more spell slots than is listed on the medium table.</p>
<p>At 7th and 15th level, you gain two spell slots or +4 to an ability and three spell slots and +6 to an ability respectively </p>

<h3>The Third Eye</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, you gain the following benefit, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>The sense. You can determine if there are any beings within your repertoire within 60 feet of you.</p>
<p>At 11th level you may use one of the following benefits instead.</p>
<p>Ethereal Sight. You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.</p>
<p>Soul Comprehension. You can understand any language spoken to you.</p>
<p>Seer's Vision. You can see any creature within 10 feet of you that is within your line of sight regardless of invisibility, blindness, or lighting.</p>

<div class=sidebar2>
	<h3 id="Sidebar: Optional Variant">Optional Variant</h3>
	<div class=sbBody>
		<p>Some mediums focus their abilities around a particular spirit that has attached itself to them. This is referred to as your 'primary' spirit. You gain your full proficiency bonuses on spirit skills and twice your proficiency bonus on shared skill proficiencies when channeling your primary spirit. In exchange, with all other spirits, you gain half of his proficiency on spirit skills as normal and no extra proficiency bonus to shared skills. Other spirits cannot be used with the Taboo feature. Time spent channeling your primary spirit does not count towards your maximum time, but running out of time while channeling another spirit will prevent you from channeling your primary spirit.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<h1>Spiritual Disciplines</h1>
<p>There are many practices that involve mediation:</p>
<ul>
	<li/> Exorcist
	<li/> Shaman
	<li/> Sha'ir
</ul>
<p>Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th level.</p>


<h2>Exorcist</h2>

<h3 class=arch>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
<p>When you carve out your niche as an Exorcist at level 1, you gain two additional proficiencies from the following skills: Deception, History, Insight, Investigation, Performance and Religion.</p>

<h3 class=arch>Seance</h3>
<p>At 1st level, you can cast speak with dead as a 10 minute ritual. This does not count against your spells known. The rite must within 30 feet of the subject's corpse and cannot have been dead for more than 30 hours. Alternatively the ritual must be cast within a place the spirit still haunts. Instead of speaking from the subject's corpse through animating energies, the spirit enters your body and speaks through your own mouth.</p>
<p>At 6th level, there is no longer a time restriction. The rite can be performed within 30 feet of the subject's mortal remains, a well-made memorial or enshrinement to the spirit or the subject's place of death. The ritual can also be performed with an item of great sentimental value to the subject in hand.
</p>

<h3 class=arch>Channel Divinity</h3>
<p>Upon reaching 6th level, You can channel divine energies much like a cleric.</p>
<h4 class=arch>Turn Spirits</h4>
<p>As an action you may enchant a phrase that wards off hostile forces. All creatures within your repertoire that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
</p>

<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
<h3 class=arch>Extradimensional Reach</h3>
<p>At 10th level you can use ghost touch on creatures regardless of where they fall between and within the material and ethereal planes. After grappling such a creature, you can pull them onto your current plane using a strength check.</p>


<h2>Shaman</h2>
<p>The shaman's abilities relate to aiding others as much as well as one's self. The shaman's filler spells should come from the druid.</p>
<h3 class=arch>Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
<p>When you are first realized as a Shaman at level 1, you gain an additional proficiency with one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Arcana, Medicine, Nature or Survival.</p>
<p>In addition you add all fey creatures to your repertoire.</p>

<h3 class=arch>Eyes of Mercy</h3>
<p>You intuitively know if a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is blinded, deafened, Fatigued, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, Stunned, Unconscious, Exhausted or has contracted a disease. Once per short rest, as an action, you can determine if a subject is charmed, petrified or possessed or if there is an invisible creature within 60 feet.</p>
<h3 class=arch>Rite of Guidance</h3>
<p>At 6th level, you can send forth spirits to aid your allies. As an action, choose an ally and an ability score. That ally can add half of your shaman level (round up) to up to 3 rolls made with that ability for the next 10 minutes. This ability can be used once per long rest.</p>
<h3 class=arch>Revealer</h3>
<p>At 10th level, you can designate any divination you cast, to be cast by another within 30 feet.</p>


<h2>Sha'ir</h2>
<p>A sha'ir is able to contact a myriad of elemental beings at his whim (and theirs) through his djinn (a mephit).</p>

<h3 class=arch>Shiqq Mediator</h3>

<p>At 1st level, you gain the services of a shiqq. In exchange, you partake in a ritual which some day make the shiqq whole. You do this by imbuing it with the elements around you, and a portion of yourself. This forever binds the shiqq to you, and allows it to take shape as you grow stronger. For this opportunity, the shiqq acts as a go-between to the elemental planes, returning with any spell you desire. Once per long rest, you can request one spell you have heard of that is of 1st level The shiqq will take an amount of time depending on where it came from. You may cast the spell the same round it arrives, but you cannot hold it longer than 30 minutes. These spella do not cost spell slots to be cast, however you may only ever hold one at any given time.</p>

<div class=sidebar>
	<h4 id="Sidebar: Shiqqun">"Huh? What are 'Shiqqun'?"</h4>
	<div class=sbBody>
		<p>Shiqqun are lesser djinn that have only half formed. As a result of this tragedy, they are often hideous and small; they are pitied by djinn across the elemental planes. A shiqq is not skilled in magic or combat itself, and will therefore rarely fully enter the material plane to interact with others besides it's sha'ir.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>If the spell is on the spell list of those who borrow from nature around them, or their own nature such as either the druid, ranger, or sorcerer, the retrieval takes 1d6 rounds + the spell's level. If the spell is not on the previous, but is a studied magic such as those on the bard, medium, or wizard's spell lists, the retrieval time is 1d12 rounds + the spell's level. If the spell can only be cast by those who devote themselves such as a cleric, paladin, or warlock, the retrieval takes 2d12 minutes per level of the spell.</p>

<h3 class=arch>Mephit Growth</h3>
<p>At 6th level, the shiqqan's form is finally made whole. Your mediator takes the form of a mephit companion. The type of mephit it becomes is often dependant on where the original ritual was cast, where you have traveled since, or even your own nature; but this is not guaranteed. Your shiqq companion crawls its way into the material plane as it transforms and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond and bonus cantrips abilities. You can have only one mephit companion at a time.</p>
<p>Your shiqq or mephit companion is sure to tell you that if it ever dies, with 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and incense it can be resurrected.</p>
<h4>Companion's Bond</h4>
<p>This mephit gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.</p>
<p>The mephit obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, the mephit acts on its own.</p>
<p>The mephit has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. The mephit uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a mephit companion also adds this proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</p>
<p>The mephit gains proficiency in one skill of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.</p>
<p>As you gain levels, the mephit companion also gains additional hit dice and increases its hit points accordingly. The mephit companion has a number of hit die equal to your level.</p>
<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, the mephit's abilities also improve. The mephit can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, the mephit can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>
<p>The mephit shares your alignment, though it's personality traits and impulses are influenced by the behaviors mentioned in it's monster entry. The mephit is prone to take on your ideal, and is willing to suffer on your behalf within reason.</p>
<p>    The mephit can retrieve spells for you once per short rest. You can request one spell of any level for which you have spell slots, though you need not have any remaining.</p>
<h4>Bonus Cantrips</h4>
<p>You and the mephit both gain two cantrips depending on what kind of mephit it is.</p>

<h1>On Spirits</h1>
<h3>What is a Spirit?</h3>
<p>A spirit... [insert explanations here...] It includes elementals, fey, fiends, celestials, ghosts, phantoms and wraiths, as well as other intangible beings not listed anywhere, such as the myriad of nature spirits throughout the world.
</p>
<h3>Spirit Quick-Build</h3>
<p>To quickly create a spirit, you need a list of 3-6 skills, some weapon proficiencies and 1-3 ability scores that represent it's physical and mental prowess it has (or had in life). There are sample sets of these below. If the being channeled is a spirit of nature or has levels in a spellcasting class, it should provide between 2-9 spells. You can simply borrow the spells of a cleric domain or a warlock patron, make your own list, or use one of the sample spell lists below. To make a spirit less useful, leave out spells over a certain level.
