</div>


<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Your expertise in the supernatural has driven you to learn to cast spells. See the <a href="spells">Medium Spell List</a>.</p>
<h4>Cantrips</h4>
<p>You begin knowing two cantrips of your choice. You learn new Medium cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Medium table.
</p>


<h4>Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The Medium table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.
</p>

<p> For example, when you are 5th level, you have one 1st, 2nd and 3rd-level spell slot. To cast the 2nd-level spell Detect Thoughts, you must spend either your 2nd or 3rd level spell slot.
</p>

<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Medium table shows when you learn new Medium spells. These must be first level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new Medium spell and this spell can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you may choose one of the Medium spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Medium spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Medium spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Medium spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a shaman's focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your Medium spells.</p>


<h3>Channeling</h3>
<p>As an action you can expend a number of spell slots and channel a willing spirit within 5 feet of you. This lasts a number of minutes equal the the level of the spell slot spent. 
</p>
<p>While channeling you gain the spirit’s spells, it's weapon proficiencies and to a lesser degree, it's skill proficiencies. Add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability checks your channeled spirit is proficient in. Add your full proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with weapons a channeled spirit is proficient in. If the spirit can cast spells, you can use your spell slots to cast them (See below). The greatest level of spirit spell you can cast is limited by your medium level, regardless of your spirit's spells or spell slots gained through multiclassing. <!--For multiclassing sake-->
</p>
<p>You can expel the spirit from your body as an action, ending all effects from channeling. After channeling a spirit, you must take a short rest before channeling a different spirit.
</p> 

<h4>Averse Spirits</h4>
<p>If a spirit is antagonistic or hostile towards you, it might still accept the union to further its own goals. You can channel an averse spirit safely for a number of rounds equal to your medium level plus your Charisma modifier. If you exceed this, you must roll a Charisma save against a DC equal to the spirit’s challenge rating plus its Charisma every round, or lose control of the possession. When this occurs, the spirit takes control of your body and you are incapacitated. You can make a new save to regain control every round at the start of your turn. This goes on until you dismiss the spirit with another save or your remaining channeling time runs out. This can also occur if you fall unconscious, or drop to 0 hit points while channeling an averse spirit.
</p>


<h4>Repertoire</h4>
<p>You become proficient in dealing with certain types of spirits. This list of creatures is used by different Medium class features.
</p>
<p>At 1st level, your repertoire includes the souls of the dead such as ghosts, phantoms and wraiths as well as one additional type of spirit determined by your spiritual discipline. You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about them, and can channel them as spirits.
</p>


<h3>Spiritual Discipline</h3>
<p>
    At 1st level, you choose a <a href="subclasses">spiritual discipline</a>, shaping your practice of magic through one of three professions: the Exorcist, the Shaman or the Sha'ir.
</p>
<p>
    Your choice grants you features at 1nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
</p>


<h3>Taboo</h3>

<div class=sidebar>
    <h3 id="Sidebar: Taboo who?">Taboo who?</h3>
    <div class=sbBody>
        <p>Taboos are certain actions that have been deemed forbidden. A taboo should restrict something not uncommon but not be hard to maintain. Generally a spirit will tell you whether you can safely take an action. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li/>Like a druid, you must not wear metal armor or use metal shields.
            <li/>You must adopt a code of honor. You must accept any challenge made against you, and you cannot use underhanded tactics such as attacking an unwary foe that is not already in combat against you or your allies.
            <li/>You cannot eat meat, kill beasts, or touch domesticated animals.
            <li/>You must dress in clean and proper clothes, maintain etiquette and avoid getting your shoes and clothes dirty. You must not walk if transportation is available.
            <li/>You cannot speak common or do anything that is too "mainstream".
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<p>At 2nd level, when you channel a spirit, you can take on one of your spirit's taboos and gain one of the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li/>When you make attack with a weapon your spirit is proficient in, you can increase the number of damage dice by 1. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. 
    <li/> You add your Constitution modifier to ability checks with one your spirit's two greatest ability scores. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
    <li/> Determine your spirit's two greatest ability scores. When a spell you cast allows a target to make a save using one of these abilities, you can choose to give it disadvantage on that save. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
</ul>
<p>The taboo must be maintained until you complete a long rest or the spirit enters a separate plane of existence besides the ethereal. Its benefits only last so long as you channel the spirit. If you break this taboo prematurely, your remaining channeling time immediately runs out and you take 1d12 necrotic damage + the spirit’s CR.
</p>


<h3>The Third Eye</h3>
<p>
    Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to open your third eye, and know if there are any creatures within 60 feet of you. You know if any are within your repertoire, if any are undead, and you know if any are the same type of creature as you. Your third eye remains open for 10 minutes, and it can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. All expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
</p>


<h3>Rites of Mediation</h3>
<p>
    In your study of occult lore, you have enacted sacred <a href="rites">rites</a>, and become aware of planes of existence not known to mortal eyes.

    At 3rd level, you enact one rite of your choice, gaining its stated effects permanently. When you gain certain Medium levels, you can enact rites of your choice, as shown in the Rites Enacted column of the Medium table.
    
    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the rites you have enacted and replace it with another rite that you could gain at that level.
    
    If a rite has prerequisites, you must meet them to enact it. You can enact the rite at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
</p>


<h1>On Spirits</h1>
<h3>What is a Spirit?</h3>
<p>A spirit... [insert explanations here...] It includes elementals, fiends, celestials, ghosts, phantoms and wraiths, as well as other intangible beings not listed anywhere, such as the myriad of nature spirits throughout the world.
</p>
<h3>How do I get Spirits to Follow Me?</h3>
<p>You learn to appease spirits and barter with supernatural forces. In order to use the channeling ability, you must first gain the aid of a spirit.
</p>
<p>    Finding a spirit is no simple task. Though many spirits reside on the mortal realm, you can’t expect to find them behind every tree and rock (The spirit of your average tree won’t be of any use). Often you will require elaborate and expensive rites to contact beings from other planes. But sometimes, a Medium need only ask around.
</p>
<p>Communing with faraway Spirits. To contact a spirit of nature, or a soul that is yet to pass, you must make an offering. This ritual takes (1d12 + the target’s CR) × 10 minutes to complete. It is unusual to need an offering worth much more than the target’s CR × 100 gp. A spirit must be summoned from a place relevant to its nature. This can be where it had passed away or somewhere close to its remains (if applicable), the domain in which it resides or the place it still haunts. It can also be in the presence of a person it knows well or an item that is significant to it. Stronger ties, yield stronger results.
</p>
<p>If the spirit is nearby, the price is instead 10 gp + it’s CR; in which case, you can expect it to appear in person, but be careful.
</p>
<p>The barter. You must then convince the spirit to accept an offer in exchange for its knowledge and power. Make a Persuasion check against a DC of 12 + the spirit’s CR. If this check fails you cannot try again until the next day. If a spirit does not share your alignment on either axis or has a more specific reason to be against your cause, it is considered averse to you. You have disadvantage when trying to convince an averse spirit to join you. An averse spirit that has a challenge rating of twice your level or more will not help you. You can only summon a spirit in this way once every long rest. Any spirit will be hesitant to follow a Medium that already has 3 in his company.
</p>
<p>Any creature covered by your repertoire can be channeled, but to do so you must spend time communing with it. Attacking such a creature will generally cause it to refuse.
</p>

<h3>Spirit Quick-Build</h3>
<p>To quickly create a spirit, you need a list of 3-6 skills, some weapon proficiencies and choose 1-3 of its ability scores that it excels in or is higher than its other scores. There are sample sets of these below. If the being channeled is a spirit of nature or has levels in a spellcasting class, it should provide between 2-9 spells. You can simply borrow the spells of a cleric domain or a warlock patron, make your own list, or use one of the sample spell lists below. To make a spirit less useful, leave out spells over a certain level. Sample sets for skills and abilities are listed after.
