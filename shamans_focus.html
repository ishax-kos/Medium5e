<p>A shaman's focus is a conduit for the soul. A medium can use a shaman's focus as a spellcasting focus, as described in the Spellcasting section. To use the focus in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or swallow it. When imbibed, a shaman's focus can be summoned into the hand at the end of channeling.</p>
