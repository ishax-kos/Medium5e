<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Your expertise in the supernatural has driven you to learn to cast spells. See the <a href="medium_spells.html">Medium Spell List</a>.</p>
<h4>Cantrips</h4>
<p>You begin knowing two cantrips of your choice. You learn new medium cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Medium table.
</p>

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>As a medium, you have one spell slot of each spell level for which you can cast spells; as shown under ‘spell level’ on the Medium table. The table also shows how many spells you know at each level. To cast one of your medium spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot of equivalent level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
</p>
<p>You prepare the list of medium spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of medium spells from your spells known equal to your Intelligence modifier + half of your medium level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have one 1st, 2nd and 3rd-level spell slot. To cast the 2nd-level spell Detect Thoughts, you must spend either your 2nd or 3rd level spell slot.
</p>

<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Medium table shows when you learn new medium spells. These must be first level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new medium spell and this spell can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.
</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you may choose one of the medium spells you know and replace it with another spell from the medium spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your medium spells*, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a medium spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
</p>
<p>* This does not apply to your spirit spells (see Channeling below).</p>
<p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a shaman's focus or a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your medium spells.</p>

<h3>Channeling</h3>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to channel a willing spirit. You can expel the spirit from your body as an action, ending all effects from channeling. After channeling a spirit, a medium must take a short rest before channeling a different spirit.
</p>
<p>When channeling, you gain the spirit’s weapon proficiencies and access to some of its abilities as noted. During this time, you also add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check that your channeled spirit is proficient in. You add your full proficiency to attack rolls made with any weapon the spirit is proficient in. If the spirit can cast spells, you can use your slots to cast them if they are of a level you can cast.
</p>

<h4>Spellcasting Under an Influence</h4>
<p>You must use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability when casting spells belonging to your spirit. You do not need to prepare them ahead of time. You use your Wisdom whenever a spirit’s spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spirit’s spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. The highest spell level you can cast is determined by the spell level column of the Medium table.
</p>
<p>Spirit spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<p>Spirit spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

<p>You can channel for two hours, but you can only safely channel an averse spirit for a number of minutes equal to your medium level. If you exceed this, you must roll a wisdom save against a DC equal to the creature’s challenge rating +10 and again every round, or lose control of the possession. When this occurs, the spirit controls your body for 1d12 minutes. This can also occur if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die while channeling an averse spirit.
</p>

<h3>Repertoire</h3>
<p>You become proficient in dealing with certain types of spirits. This list of creatures is used by different medium class features.
</p>
<p>At 1st level, your repertoire includes the souls of the dead such as ghosts, phantoms and wraiths as well as one additional type of spirit determined by your spiritual discipline. You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.
</p>


<h3>Spiritual Discipline</h3>
<p>
	At 1st level, you choose a <a href="medium_subclasses.html">spiritual siscipline</a>, shaping your practice of magic through one of three professions: the Exorcist, the Shaman or the Sha'ir.
</p>
<p>
	Your choice grants you features at 1nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
</p>


<div class=sidebar>
	<h3 id="Sidebar: Taboo who?">Taboo who?</h3>
	<div class=sbBody>
		<p>Taboos are certain actions that have been deemed forbidden. A taboo should restrict something not uncommon but not be hard to maintian. Generaly a spirit will tell you wheather you can safely take an action. Here are some examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li/>Like a druid, you must not wear metal armor or use metal shields.
			<li/>You must adopt a code of honor. You must accept any challenge made against you, and you cannot use underhanded tactics such as attacking an unwary foe that is not already in combat against you or your allies.
			<li/>You cannot eat meat, kill beasts, or touch domesticated animals.
			<li/>You must dress in clean and proper clothes, maintain ettiquite and avoid getting your shoes and clothes dirty. You must not walk if transportation is avaliable.
			<li/>You cannot speak common or do anything that is too "mainstream".
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

<h3>Taboo</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, once per short rest, you can take on a taboo befitting the spirit you are currently channeling in order to earn greater cooperation. The taboo must be maintained until you complete a long rest. If you break this taboo, your remaining channeling time immediately runs out and you take 1d12 necrotic damage + the spirit’s CR. When you take on a taboo, you gain one of the following abilities:
	<p>You gain an aditional spell slot according to the spell level column on the Medium table. This extra spell slot is lost when your taboo ends or is broken.</p>
	<p>You gain your proficiency bonus on all ability checks with one of the spirit’s exemplary ability scores. This refers to either the spirit’s greatest ability score, or one that is greater than your own.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Third Eye</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to open your third eye, and know if there are any creatures within 60 feet of you. You know if any of them are beings within your repertoire, if any are undead, and you know if any are the same type of creature as you. Your third eye remains open for 10 minutes, and it can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. All expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
</p>

<h3>Rites of Mediation</h3>
<p>
	In your study of occult lore, you have enacted sacret <a href="medium_rites.html">rites</a>, and become aware of planes of existence not known to mortal eyes.

	At 3rd level, you enact one rite of your choice, gaining its stated effects permanently. When you gain certain medium levels, you can enact rites of your choice, as shown in the Rites Enacted column of the Medium table.
	
	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the rites you have enacted and replace it with another rite that you could gain at that level.
	
	If a rite has prerequisites, you must meet them to enact it. You can enact the rite at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
</p>

<h1>On Spirits</h1>
<h3>What is a Spirit?</h3>
<p>A spirit... [insert explanations here...] It includes elementals, fiends, celestials, ghosts, phantoms and wraiths, as well as other intangible beings not listed anywhere, such as the myriad of nature spirits throughout the world.
</p>
<h3>How do I get Spirits to Follow Me?</h3>
<p>You learn to appease spirits and barter with supernatural forces. In order to use the channeling ability, you must first gain the aid of a spirit.
</p>
<p>	Finding a spirit is no simple task. Though many spirits reside on the mortal realm, you can’t expect to find them behind every tree and rock (The spirit of your average tree won’t be of any use). Often you will require elaborate and expensive rites to contact beings from other planes. But sometimes, a medium need only ask around.
</p>
<p>Communing with faraway Spirits. To contact a spirit of nature, or a soul that is yet to pass, you must make an offering. This ritual takes (1d12 + the target’s CR) × 10 minutes to complete. It is unusual to need an offering worth much more than the target’s CR × 100 gp. A spirit must be summoned from a place relevant to its nature. This can be where it had passed away or somewhere close to its remains (if applicable), the domain in which it resides or the place it still haunts. It can also be in the presence of a person it knows well or an item that is significant to it. Stronger ties, yield stronger results.
</p>
<p>If the spirit is nearby, the price is instead 10 gp + it’s CR; in which case, you can expect it to appear in person, but be carefull.
</p>
<p>The barter. You must then convince the spirit to accept an offer in exchange for its knowledge and power. Make a Persuasion check against a DC of 12 + the spirit’s CR. If this check fails you cannot try again until the next day. If a spirit does not share your alignment on either axis or has a more specific reason to be against your cause, it is considered averse to you. You have disadvantage when trying to convince an averse spirit to join you. An averse spirit that has a challenge rating of twice your level or more will not help you. You can only summon a spirit in this way once every long rest. Any spirit will be hesitant to follow a medium that already has 3 in his company.
</p>
<p>Any creature covered by your repertoire can be channeled, but to do so you must spend time communing with it. Attacking such a creature will generally cause it to refuse.
</p>

<h3>Spirit Quick-Build</h3>
<p>To quickly create a spirit, you need a list of 3-6 skills, some weapon proficiencies and choose 1-3 of its ability scores that excels at or is higher than its other scores. There are sample sets of these below. If the being channeled is a spirit of nature or has levels in a spellcasting class, it should provide between 2-9 spells. You can simply borrow the spells of a cleric domain or a warlock patron, make your own list, or use one of the sample spell lists below. To make a spirit less useful, leave out spells over a certain level. Sample sets for skills and abilities are listed after.
