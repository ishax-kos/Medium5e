                You dedicate yourself to a single spirit. When channeling this spirit, you gain your full proficiency bonuses when using the spirit's skills as well as twice your proficiency bonus in skills and with weapons you both have proficiency with. With all other spirits you must take on a taboo, or the normal benifits of channeling are not gained. Time spent channeling your primary spirit does not count towards your maximum time, but running out of time while channeling another spirit will prevent you from channeling your primary spirit.
